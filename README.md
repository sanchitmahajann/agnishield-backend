# 🛡️ AGNISHIELD Backend

## 📄 Project Overview

This project aims to detect phishing URLs using machine learning and FastAPI. The system analyzes various features extracted from URLs to classify them as either "safe" or "phishing." It leverages an XGBoost model trained on a balanced dataset of legitimate and phishing URLs, with preprocessing and feature extraction steps implemented in Python.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Accurate Phishing Detection**: Utilizes machine learning algorithms to classify URLs as phishing or safe.
- **Feature Extraction**: Extracts 11 features from URLs, including entropy, dangerous characters, suspicious keywords, and PCA-transformed attributes.
- **FastAPI Backend**: Provides an API endpoint for real-time URL classification.
- **Scalable Deployment**: Easily deployable using Uvicorn and GitHub.

## 📝 Feature Extraction Details

The following features are extracted from URLs for classification:

| Feature Name                | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| URL length                  | Length of the URL                                                          |
| Number of dots              | Count of dots (`.`) in the URL                                              |
| Number of slashes           | Count of slashes (`/`) in the URL                                           |
| Percentage of numerical characters | Ratio of numerical characters in the URL                                |
| Dangerous characters        | Presence of special characters (`@`, `;`, `%`, etc.)                       |
| Dangerous TLD               | Flag for dangerous top-level domains (`cm`, `date`, `xyz`)                 |
| Entropy                     | Measure of randomness in the URL                                            |
| IP Address                  | Flag if the URL contains an IP address                                      |
| Domain name length          | Length of the domain name                                                  |
| Suspicious keywords         | Presence of keywords like `login`, `verify`, `secure`, `account`           |
| Repetitions                 | Count of repeated characters (e.g., `aaaa`)                                |
| Redirections                | Count of redirections (`//`)                                               |

## 📊 Model Training Workflow

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Gathered phishing URLs from open-source platforms like PhishTank.
   - Collected legitimate URLs from public datasets.

2. **Feature Extraction**:
   - Extracted relevant features from URLs (e.g., entropy, dangerous characters).

3. **Model Training**:
   - Balanced dataset using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).
   - Trained multiple models and selected XGBoost based on performance metrics.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Achieved ~87% accuracy on test data.

5. **Deployment**:
   - Saved trained model and preprocessing components (PCA transformer and scaler).
   - Integrated with FastAPI for real-time predictions.
